      "quote": "I’ve known Holman for years and have recently had the pleasure of hiring him as a freelance developer.  Holman ramped up on an existing code base with ease and quickly executed on core features of my web app.  He is my go-to person for complex, on-demand projects, proving himself to be versatile at all levels of the stack from CSS tweaks to debugging database calls.  The best part is that I trust Holman with senior engineering decisions - he is genuinely thoughtful when it comes to architecting applications and understands the “big picture.”  For these reasons hiring Holman has without a doubt been my best experience with a freelance developer."

      "quote": "I hired Holman to help build out my start-up, and I was thrilled with the quality of his work.  He started contributing immediately and thrived with all types of tasks, from implementing UI mocks to database-level changes.  He communicated well and kept me updated, which allowed me to worry less about his progress.  The project got to a point where I trusted him and I didn't need to review his work.  I would be happy to work with him again in the future!"
